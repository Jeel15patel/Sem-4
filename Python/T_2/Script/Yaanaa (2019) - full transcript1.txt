love you...I missed youI told you other daydo we need this election?is this speech necessary?no opposition canditate here...announce my name as the President...how did you hide it in your heart all these days?we shared ur problems with you right!?any girl on this earth can face your problems...but the insult I faced...they know very well whatever they do girls don't speak outboys behave so rudely...you have to bring out his other face in public...only then you will get justice...if you fear even a dog will chase you...but, if you revolt, even a tiger will flee...Hello...hello everbody...you all must be wondering...how did she come here after all the insult?to be frank, for a few days even I felt the samewhy just that, even I felt like dying...even thought of locking me up in four wallsI wished no one sees methis election...college...life... everything is bullshit...I don't need this...anyway the end is near...thought, let me make my end differently thinking so I stepped out...the moment I came out, you know what I felt...!to my surpise I felt no one knew me here...everybody's life was important to them...me alongwith my insult felt lonely in this world...that moment I realised...that my insult was my companion...really it might seem bizzare to you...if I say the girl you saw in the MMS isn't me...few who have affection towards me will believebut, I don't wish to lie...yes, I am the same girl...yes...it's me...if I think of the incident which happened on that day...my heart bleeds...it is not that I made a mistake...to be precise I haven't done any mistakeI shared some intense moments with someone I really loved...my love was pure...I was in love...okay...if I didn't do a mistake... where did the mistake happen?the mistake happened in my trust...the thought that the boy I am in love, loved me too...the mistake was in my innocence...I didn't realise it on that day...on seeing the MMS he created...I was shocked...I was devastated...from there, to end my life, I found another begining...the new begining gave me a new perspective...my agony...insult...weakness ended...now I am transformed...I am a new girl todaysome day in future the same might happen to any one of you...at that time face it with courage...boys behave so rudely only because...they know very well whatever they do girls don't speak outif you fear even a dog will chase you...but, if you revolt, even a tiger will flee...the reason for my courage are...my friends who were strangers till yesterday...Maya...and Anjali...they are my soulmates...Thank youthank you so much...the other day what did you tell me on this spot?that you finished me right?you said, you are finished...but guess what...I am back...you know what is the life of your MMS?it's alive till a new MMS crops up...then it will be a gossip...later it will be dud...in the name of love how did you wish to do this!?remember this...the day girls stand up facing their insult...masculinity of boys like you will be a nil...a big Zero...a few of you might have stored the MMS...that's your wish...I will not urge you to delete itif you know that it is a cheating done by some one to another soul...That's enough...I am least bothered about the election result...I am already a winner...my journey has taught me, not to run away from my problems...but, to face it...Thank you...Thank you so
