He has been living in Londonfor the past 25 years,-and now he's returned to India.-Really?-But he's a true Indian.-Wow!London!A house over there...and that's the other house.Shalini.Happy birthday, dear.The priest gave me a garlandto put it on your photo.But... garlands are offeredto someone who is dead.But you aren't dead.


You are still with me.You are with me every moment.Happy birthday, my dear!My dear!My dear!There's no news of Sania yet.It's 3 a.m.I will go check my place again.Where have you been?I was at my friend's birthday party.Do you realize how late it is?Aren't... Aren't you ashamed?I've been looking for you for four hours.Why? I'm not a kid!


Go to bed, Papa.We'll talk in the morning.Why can't we talk now?-You are drunk.-I just had wine, not alcohol.You had wine?I said we'll talk in the morning.Or else I'll file a complaint against youto the police.Sania, are you out of your mind?If you can't answeryour children's questions,you can never be their friend.-Drinking Coke in the store?-Why not?I know your weakness.We have Coke at home.I don't have one, but two weaknesses.First is Cokeand the other is your beautiful hair.Besides, this is the best coolantfor a hot-head person like me.Here's a coolant for your hot head.Look at this greeting card.Sanskrit verses.The only time I heard and spoke Sanskritwas at my weddingwhen the priest recited the mumbo-jumboand then I heardBuckingham, Birmingham!You are a Sanskrit scholar. A professor.You teach at London University.Could you please translate this for me?What does it mean?It says, we should love our kidsand spoil them till they are five.Once they turn ten,you should keep tabs on them.But once they turn 16,you should be friends with them.Get that, mister?Once they turn 16,you should be their friend.If you want a happy home, forever.-It's an old hat.-But it's new for the younger generation.Friendship with daughters!For a father like me,that too, in an alien land.Return the trolley. I'll be in the car.Yes, sir. Always.Shalini!Shalini!Get up.Dear.Shalu.Shalu. Oh God!No!Shalu.This is not done.The doctor gave me only two minutesto talk to you.No, love, I'm with you.But... I never took a single breathwithout you in the past 25 years.You've taken care of everything.What am I going to do now?The house, daughters.How am I going to take care of them?What will I tell them?You will talk to them, my dear.You are their mother...and father too.Just promise me one thing.Tell me, love.Until they get married...don't stay away from them...be friends with them.My love, how will I do it?Ever since they've grown up,I never had a chat with them.Remember those Sanskrit verses?Yes.Shalu!Give our three daughters a grand farewell.Understand them...and make them understand.There! I've slapped you.Come with me to the police.-Isha!-Report me.Isha!We have been friends for 25 years.If not us, who else will youshare your feelings to?You are like family.Who else will I tell this to?Stop bickering over petty issues.So what if they're daughters?The world is full of daughters.LK, he can't handle themmeans he really can't.If you can be best friendto my son, Ronit,then why not your daughters?Tell me.LK, daughters are different.Right, Dr Javed?What are you going to do then?I'm thinking of going back to India.For a change.Still, it's very tough for a fatherto be a mother as well.I'll try. Goodbye!Kids these days!I put Ronit in a hostelever since he was a kid.Let him grow there.Just let him grow there.That's why I left my kids in Lahore.I told them, kids should staywhere they belong.You can hit me. Show no mercy.I had lost my mind.No, dear.You're the best.-You are...-Papa.Three of us took an oath todaythat we'll never hurt you and never fight.It's all my fault.It's completely my fault.I have realized thatyour mother was your best friend.A father only provides.Money and comforts.But a mother...is your best friendwho shares your problems and sorrows.But... I didn't.I couldn't share your feelings.No, Papa.Now that Ma is gone,you are our friend.We'll do whatever you say.Thank you, children.There's only one placewhich is full of light and hope.My India.Ever since my friend Rajhas gone to India,London seems like a city of ruins to me.My friend has gone.Now worry about your son.He will go to India,looking for Raj, right?It's obvious, sweetheart.Raj is like a mother,a father and a friend to him.Yes. We are not his parents.We are, but in the name only.Ronit is Raj and Shalini's son.He has inherited their natureand their perspective.That's why he behaves likea middle-class guy.Hundred percent, Nalini.He left this huge palaceand opened a studio.He's an artist.Indian music!It unites millions of Asian Indiansacross the world by a single thread.Indian music ends all quarrelsover race and creed.Teaches one language to Punjabis,Maharashtrians, Gujaratis, Bengalis...Makes every Indian a global Indian.For friendship, love, marriage,Ronit, Uncle Raj called for you.Sent an email, too.Don't forget to read it.-Uncle Raj.-Yes, Uncle Raj.-for anything less than 500,000 dollars.-Right.If they agree, then great,or else ask them to...I went to India without informing you.Lalit will tell you the reason.Sorry, pal, I had to go.It's pointless telling youthat we miss you.We talk about you all the time.Today I was telling Isha and Avantikaabout the incident in your college,when Shalini and I visited you.You had just been awardedthe trophy for thebest student in the college.Instead of going to Lalit and Nalini,you came to me directly.You forgot your parentsand you touched Shalini's feet.Lalit was so jealous! I remember.And Shalini was so happy.With memories like these,we're trying to begin a new life.Isha will have to go to Londonto complete her education.Take care of yourself, Ronit.Your best friend, Uncle Raj.There are songsThere are complaintsThere are storiesThere are wordsThere are songsThere are complaintsThere are storiesThere are wordsWords are forgottenNot the memoriesWords are forgottenNot the memoriesCherished memories of our loved onesThey return when they're goneMemories!Memories!Memories!My darling, this lifeIs like flowing waterAfter the water has flownWhat remains?Memories!Memories!Memories!There is loveThere are complaintsThere are storiesThere are wordsWords are forgottenNot the memoriesCherished memories of loved onesReturn in our lives when they're goneMemories!Memories!Memories!"There are songs and complaints.There are stories and words.Words are forgotten.Not the memories.Cherished memories of loved ones,return in our lives when they're gone.These memories, oh, memories.Memories!"Memories!All of us, everyoneLong for cherished memoriesSome happiness, bits of sorrowsThey belong to usWe belong to themMemories!Sweet memories!Bittersweet memoriesThere are songsThere are complaintsThere are stories and wordsWords are forgottenNot the memoriesCherished memories of our loved onesThey return when they're goneMemories!Memories!Memories!Memories!Our stock were down till yesterday,not today.Just wait till Mondayand it will surely rise.Sir, we're prayingto the Goddess of Fortune.Now She is bound to grace my home.Inform Enam Mutual Funds.

Finally you remember me?All forgotten.the whole world has turned into a dot-com,which helps bring Indians in everycorner of the world closer.Those who don't want to fall inlove, can get married straightaway.-How come?-Take yourself for instance.If we have to find a handsome boywho is worthy of you,where and how to findthe most suitable guy.Now you have come to the point! Tell us.Computer, advise us where to finda suitable, handsome boy,the right match for Avantika.There you go.Three eligible boys. You have a choice.I like all of them.Let's get all three of them married.It's solved, right?The boy in the middle is Pankaj Kudesia.I know him.-How?-We studied together in London.He's a vice presidentat Hotel Surya in Delhi.He lived in London,but he's still Indian.This is the best thing about him.-What do you say, Avantika?-I don't know.There's a boy for Sania too.Take a look.-Find someone for our Isha too.-Yeah, of course. Just a minute.-Mindy!-Yes?Please upload Isha's pictureon the website.There you go."Please wait.An eligible man for Isha."What is that, buddy?The computer found the match.What can I do?Even your mom used to complain.Ties are always a hassle.Be frank while talkingto the suitor's family.Isha, you know I'm not good at that."Yes, sir. No, sir.Please eat, drink and all that."I'm glad I have Ronit with me.Otherwise...What can Ronit do? He's too young.The elders should always do the talking.-Stop depending on him.-But I...No ifs and buts.Mr. Raj, Ronit and Pankaj,both of them are like a son to me.Ronit told us everything about Avantika.All I wanted was to meet you.-And here we are.-Even I wanted...What I wanted, Ronit...He wanted to meet you and ask you...After all, the wedding arrangements...If you have any conditions or demands...You know?Exactly! Let me knowyour demands or conditions.I'll fulfill everything.Mr. Raj, decent parents,a good girl and a simple wedding,are my three conditions.And nothing else.Yes. Don't worry.Avantika won't face any problemsat our place.That's exactly what I meant.I hope I was within my limits.It's not about crossing the limits.I just want him to be frank and bold.Just one color, you know.Different shades create problems.Be it black or white.If it's black,it should be completely black.If it's white,it should be completely white.But some people willruin the best of situations,by trying to mix black with white.That's where the confusion arisesand confusion leads to problems.And it is very difficult to find solutionfor every problem.Now that we have met you,we'll find a right solution.One must be alert.Not that there's any problem.Cover it.Babulal is on the line.Excuse me.How about tea or something?It's been quite a while.No. Thank you!How long have you been working here?He is not a servant.Meet Mr. Khanna.My daddy's friend for 35 years.He owns a golf club.I'm as good as a servant.Being friends with Mohanlalis just like being a servant.Enough!

Sorry.Here's your message.Here's your gift from papa. Not from me.From papa?Put this on my wrist, will you?One for Sania and the other for you.For me?Why?I don't want to get married.Till?Till I finish college.And then?I'll do whatever papa says.-Arranged or love marriage?-I don't believe in love.I know. But why?Those who fall in love aregood-for-nothing.It's too dramatic.In real life,love's an entertainment packagethat you get when you are young adults.When girls like you fall in love,it all leads to great love stories.Girls like me only make history,not love stories.Remember, a day will come,when a handsome young manwill move you to tears.Your love story will begin that very day.They will fall in love.They surely will.I am asking you! Who is this guy?Who is he?Papa, he's Sukant.I've known him for a year.He lives in Delhi.I'm in love with him.But I've seen him with goons,outside our house in London.-And...-Yes, Papa, but Sukant is good at heart.Besides, we've decided to get married.Oh I see. So everything has been decided?Then you don't need me anymore. Right?I should at least have the rightto choose my husband.Listen, your daughter loves our son.And our son loves both of us.After all, he's our only son.He has returned after completinghis education in London.I don't know what to say.We got many marriage proposalsfor our son,but we turned them all down.Now both of them are in love!To hell with love!Our son! He's such a gem, I tell you.Your daughter is also very pretty.She looks prettier when she dresses up.Mama, please. Don't talk too much.I'm not talking too much.We're finalizing wedding details.We should talk openly.-Right, Raj?-Yes.I want you to talk to me openly.-There you go!-Sorry?We don't want dowry.You can give your daughterwhatever you want.We have no objection.Not at all!We don't want jacketsand expensive clothes.But the wedding must take placeat a five-star hotel. Hotel Surya.We've got a status to maintain.After all, this isn't only abouttheir marriage.This relationship continuesafter marriage as well.The real relationship beginsafter marriage.We'll keep visiting each other.We aren't greedy. Not at all!-Uncle, you haven't eaten anything.-No, dear.I don't feel like eating. I'm in a hurry.-That's it?-Great!I don't understand.Am I marrying Sukant or his family?That's what I am trying to explaintime and again.After marriage, your name willneither be Sweetheart nor Mrs. Sukant.A married woman has to fulfillso many relationships.Daughter-in-law, aunt, etc.You have to fulfill your dutytowards those relationships.His family is not worthy of you.You don't want me to be happy.I understood. But I've made my decision.That's it.Then listen to my decision too.Did you see that?Papa.Isha.Avantika.I heard everything.I'll try to convince her.It's a tough task for a fatherto convince her daughters.What are you staring at?Get out! Get out from here.Where do they come from?Let go of me!I don't want to live anymore!-Why is she crying?-Sania poured kerosene on herself.She's trying to set herself ablaze!Leave me alone! Let me die!I want to go to my mother!Have you gone mad?At least think of us, think about papa!-Do you know what you're doing?-Does anyone care about me?-I don't want to live.-Sania!-Have you gone mad?-Yes, I have!Let go of her! Come on, let her go.Let go of her.Sania, what's the matter?-You aren't my papa!-Yes, I am not.-You aren't!-No, I'm not. Listen to me.Come with me and listen to me.Cool down. Come and listen to me.Listen to me, dear.I tried to reason with you...but you didn't relent.Now everything will happenas per your wish.You're going to marrythe man you want. Okay?-Sukant?-Yes. To Sukant.But remember one thing.The future of this marriageis solely your responsibility.I'll manage.Avantika, Isha,let's prepare for the wedding.Delhi, full of generous people.-Greetings from the heart.-Salute!So finally,Sania and Sukant's love triumphs.Love is such a strange thing!At sometime or the other,somewhere or the other,everyone without exceptionhas fallen in love.Some love stories have been successful,some were unrequited.But their love will always be remembered.In the name of love,all the youngsters have decided,that tonight...I'm not going to sing.

Where's Ronit?Inside.-I'm going to meet Mr. Rai...-Papa, I'll talk to you later.Dear...Avantika!You called at the right time!She suppressed her emotionsand tried to pretend she wasn't in lovethen at some point,those emotions burst out as tearsand the truth finally tumbles out.Yet it's truethat Isha doesn't love me.Because even without me, Isha can smile...Isha can cry.Isha doesn't love me.Because she can live without me.Talk to your sister.Then why don't you say you love me?Why don't you say it?I love you!I love you a lot.I've loved you since we were in school.I loved you since we were kids.And I still love you.But you're my friend, aren't you?How can I be your lover?Sometimes, I just feel like crying.I'm sorry, I broke down.You're supposed to take Monishkato Mr. Mittal's for dinner.You don't remember a thing.Go on... I'm leaving.Where are you guys?Uncle Raj, where are you?I need to talk to you.I'm going to meet Mr. Raiat Harry's Club.Meet me there.The manager won't let me in.I need Mr. Rai to sign these papersand give it to Mr. Jagdish.Give it to me,I will get them signed for you.Stay right here, I need to talk to you.-Uncle Raj.-What happened?I just spoke to the manager.You can go in.-Go!-Should I go alone?All the rich people are in there.I was feeling a bit embarrassed.You sure, right?Scoundrels!You just need one Coke to think straight.So did you like my in-laws' party?Shameful!So what do you think?Why are you concerned about their family?Monishka will live with your family.It's not the other way around.-Okay.-Mr. Son-in-law.In that case,you gotta do me one last favor.What?I'm taking Monishkato Radisson Hampshire tonight.All you have to do is askmy fiancÃ©e three questions.Three questions?So what are your three questions?Go ahead.My dear...This is the first questionfrom the Malhotra family.After the wedding,will you live with Ronit's parents?-Or your place?-Of course, my place.What do the parents have to do?And...they better visit onlyafter taking an appointment.Parents too?She's from America.Life out there is so stressful and busy.Isn't it?My child, my second question is,I hear you love late night parties,and you come home late as well?That's good. That's not a problem.So even after you're married,these late nights will continue?Getting married doesn't meangiving up my friends, my independence.After we're married,she can come and go as she wishes.Why are you asking these questionswhen I don't mind, Uncle Raj?My third question is,Lalit says that after marriage,you should have a little baby.I've already clarified this with Ronit.I don't want a babyfor at least four or five years.Because I don't want to ruin my figure.But this is a part of our culture.You have duties-towards your parents, their happiness...-Ronit!I think your uncle is from backwaters.I don't like to have discussionswith a small fry like you.All I could think of youas the pimp of Malhotra familyand nothing else.Monishka!Please sit down. I'll go.-No, Uncle Raj.-No, my friend. Please sit down.Nobody could do what you did today.I was fed up with these people,but how could I tell them?That I love you.Excuse me, Lalit, sister-in-law.What are you saying, Raj?It's true. I proposed this marriage.Now I'm trying to break it off.I'm telling the truth.What are you trying to break off?Ronit's engagement to Monishka.From what I've seen,neither the girl nor the familyis any good for Ronit.We're getting him marriedjust for the sake of money.Raj, I knew somedayyour patience would end.Patience?Before you came here,I received a call from Raiabout what you've seenand what the reality is.They are rich folks, Raj.They have a different lifestyle.They're different.For a middle-class restaurateur like you,all this may be startling.Monishka's ideas aren't compatiblewith Ronit's.Only you are opposed to her, Raj.Didn't I always tell you, Lalit,to stay clear ofthis poor friend of yours?Because someday or the other,he'll show you how petty he is.Jagdish!The truth is, Raj and Shalinialways had plans for your sonever since he was a boy.Ronit was like a checkthat was worth 50 billion.They wanted to own him.But it was Rai who cashed him.In the heat of the moment,he proposed that Monishkaand Ronit get married.But it shattered his daughterIsha's dreams.She had her eyes on Ronit.Lalit,this was their scheme to break upthe engagement, for Isha's benefit.But now we all know, don't we, Shelley?Do you want me to show yousome photos for evidence?Would you like to see Ronit's armssnaking over Isha's waistand all over?If you were not my friendLalit's elder brother...whom I respected as my elder brotherthen today and now...I would've slapped you so hard that...you'd carry my fingerprintsall your life.Raj!Listen carefully, Jagdish Malhotra.Isha and Ronit love eachother very much, very dearly.But they have learnedto respect their elders.Because they respect you...and also for my sake...they buried their loveand they wiped off their tears.And the photographs you speak of...Had they wantedthey could've blown them up,and plastered them all over your house.Then... neither you...nor your father could stop that.-You're crossing the limit, Raj!-I'm heartbroken!I'm heartbroken!Let me have my say, Lalit.He has insulted our friendship.He has insulted my daughter.I swear upon my mother.I swear upon Shalini!Neither my daughter nor will Iever enter this house again.For us, you are dead!-Raj.-Forget it, man!Even you turned out to bea coward, friend!My friend, a coward!Uncle Raj!What's this, Papa?You are crying instead of consoling us.No!This won't do. Come home.There are songsThere are complaintsThere are talesThere are promises!Words are forgottenMemories return!Cherished memories of loved onesReturn in our lives when they're gone.Memories!Memories!Memories!Hello, Sania, Ronit here.Give the phone to Isha.Isha isn't at homeand I don't think you should call here.Isha.Attend the calland face the truth.Hello, Isha, listen to me.Listen to me carefully.We have invited 100 VIPs in the world.Two big companies are goingthrough a merger on Monday.Children of two great familieswill be engagedand the wedding date will be finalized.Malhotras and Rais will climbto number two from number ten.Ronit. And yes,here's your engagement ring.See if it fits.-Come, son.-Don't call me son, madam.Ronit, I'm your mother.Sorry, ma'am, but you aren't my mother!You don't even knowthat your son has grown up.I'm no longer a boy with little fingers.Because you're one of those motherswho never held her son's fingers,and taught him how to walk.-Ronit?-You never even looked at your son.You never looked into my eyes,never tried to understand my anguish.You...You aren't a mother.You're just an executive directorin this marketplacewhere relationships and emotionsare cheap and expendable.I don't want to stay here.I don't want to staywhere there's no mother.-Where there's no father.-Son!Don't call me son!Don't call me son!-I'm your mother.-Are you?Then save me, save your son.Save your son from the fire thatyour family wants to throw me into.Can you save me?You can't.You can't save me.For 40 years, I've put my blood,heart, soul and mindin building these companies.I have taken the Malhotra familyinto the top ten!What do you guys want now?You want the businesses that haveprospered for years to be ruined?You want this house to be turnedinto a memorial for lovers?This is a business houseand will always be a business house.If anyone tries to insult meor tries to stand in my way,I'm going to shoot himand then I'll shoot myself.Anyone who sides with Ronitwill be responsible for my death.Is everyone listening?Kuldeep, this boy has rebelled.Look, Ronit.I want to meet Isha.Go on, see him.He's bleeding.Tell me.What do you want to say?Isha! Ronit!Where are you taking me?I want your decision beforethis world decides our fate.Are you with me or not?Ronit!We have to make a decision today.Life? Or death?-Death?-Yes, death.No!Ronit should be brought back.Only one man can compel himto attend tomorrow's function.-Who?-Only Raj.To save this 50 billion corporation,-you must overcome your vanity...-And beg?Maybe, yes.Please try to understandthe gravity of the situation.I'm only asking you to accompany me.I'll talk to Raj. You needn't say a word."Cherished memories of loved onesreturn after they're gone."-You know...-Well said!Yeah? Thank you. I'll be right back.Raj...Sister-in-law!-Ronit has run away.-What?-Ran away?-Maybe.Where?Ran away!He ran away! This was bound to happen!Why don't you ask Mr. Richie Rich's500 million pound companyto find the boy?Find him if you can.I know you can't.Let's sit inside and talk.You folks are his parents.Parents, period.Guardians.You don't rule him.They're lovers... they're in love!The lovers... have flown.They have fled.Oh moon!Oh stars!Listen, everyone!Oh moon!Oh stars!Listen, everyone!I think of youWhen I sleep, when wake up.What's the whole worldCompared to your love?Oh moon!Oh stars!Listen, everyone!I think of youWhen I wake up, when I sleepWhat's the whole worldCompared to your love?You and I will love each other so muchYou and I will love each other so muchAnyone who hears will sayWho has lived forever? Who lives forever?Love it was, love it will beLove it was, love it will beIn your heart, in my heartIn your heart, in my heartLet nothing remain unspokenTime flows like a riverLet go of the riverbankLest the waters pass us byLet go of the riverbankLest the waters pass us byOh, moon!Oh, stars!Listen, everyone!I think of youWhen I wake up, when I sleepWhat's the whole worldCompared to your love?Memories!Great, my friend.As the girl's father, if I lodgea complaint with the police,you might land in jail.Do you know that?That's exactly what I want.If our families refuse to endorseour love... let the world decide.At 5 p.m. today,your engagement to Monishkawill be officially announced.The merger agreement betweenthe two companies will be signed.I'm not going anywhere today.-What if I ask you to go?-No chance.Ah... Oh?Your mother is on the line.Today is a historic dayfor the Malhotra and Rai family.Along with the merger oftwo great companies,two families are also enteringinto wedlock.After this ring ceremony,our children Ronit and Monishka,will commit themselvesto married life together.Question to the chairman of our company,Mr. JKM is,to whom goes the credit forthis historic day?Wait a minute.Let me come over to you.Tell us.-Go on.-Go on.Its credit goes...to all of us.All of us? Or just one?One? I mean all of us.A person,without whom, this eveningwouldn't have been made possible?-Possibly.-Tell us.Raj Singh Puri.-Oh, yes, yes. Raj Singh Puri.-He said it finally.Applause.The man who has unitedtwo companies, two children.A few words for this man.Don't say it like that.Say it with an open heart.I'm saying it with an open heart.Our chairman, Jagdish, wantsto present a bouquetand shawl to Mr. Raj Singh Puri.Very magnanimous of himto honor a small fry like me.I consider the honor of his family...to be my family honor.I recall a few lines my wife once wrote."You enter life,you leave itwhen you enter, bring,when you leave, give away,memories, memories and memories!"There are songsThere are complaintsThere are storiesThere are wordsThere are songsThere are complaintsThere are storiesThere are wordsWords are forgottenNot the memoriesWords are forgottenNot the memoriesMemories!Thank you.Memories!Memories!Stop, Uncle Raj.Stop.Please stop.Just a while longer.Everyone made grand speechesand earned lots of brownie points.That also put usin a positive light.For the first time today,my mother has encouraged me.She called me home, told me..."Son, speak your mindand tell the truth."She told me not to hide...not to resort to lies.These people...who addressed you today...all of them lied to you.They told you blatant lies.Because this is a stage, a public place,even Satan speaks with Godwith dignity from a public stage.Yes, son, you're right!But you are the society,the public-at-large.Let's see...who amongst you supports the truth.I have a few questions.Each of you has the merger report,one side red and the other green.If I'm wrong, say I'm wrong.If I'm right, say I'm right.Don't you say yes, if I'm lying.Now give me a few answers.-What is he up to?-It's a public trial.My first question.Apologizing.Apologizing to fool the publicwhen your heart is filled with venom?Is that right or wrong?Now... honor.Family honor!Turning a blind eye to the fact,that greed is the cornerstoneof family honor?Is that right or wrong?Culture is the cornerstoneof family honor, Uncle Raj.Not money.Now, let's turn to a love story.A girl was in lovebut she sacrificed her lovefor her father's sake.Is that right or wrong?And the boy,acceded to his father's demandsand sold himself to the marketplace.And his family will force himto marry a rich heiressto jack up their company'sstock market valuation.Raj, wait.So this story ends with thetriumph of money. Love loses.I heard that parents...would sell themselvesfor their children's happiness.But today,they are selling their childrenfor their ambitions.Money comes first...children are secondary.Is this betterment?Is this growth? Is this progress?Emotions, love, friendships,relationships, culture...they mean nothing?What gospel is this?What gospel are our elderstrying to teach us?All right.All right.In a while from now...I'll slip this ring on Monishka's finger.And I'll sell myself...to this company and Monishka.But my question is...will this diamond...or a few rituals...be enough to unite two souls?Is the union complete?Speak up! Give me an answer!Am I to marry for the sake of the merger?Or should I marry the one to whomI've given my heart... and my life?Speak up! Give me an answer!I'll tell you.Monishka!Strange! You cannot answerRonit's simple question?Because you are a part ofthe Globex International merger?Are you evading the truthunder influence ofthe high and the mighty?The truth is...marriages are meant to follow hearts,not mergers.Ronit is right. Diamonds and ritualsdon't make a marriage.Marriage is a union of hearts and souls.I ask Ronit's true love to come on stageand in the presence of all of us here,let her give Ronit this ring.So I call upon Isha Puri,to come on stageand accept this engagement ring.-Isha Puri!-Where is she?Isha Puri!Isha Puri!Isha isn't here.Today when you wishto insult your families...you may find Saniaand me to be part of this.But not Isha.She has left.Where is Isha?JKM, this merger won't take place.For the first time,the young children have made me realize,how good and honest they are...and how corrupt we are.Especially you and I.And thank you!He was the worst,yet he understood the children.And you are still thinking? Great!Papa!Papa!Papa!-Papa!-Hey! Isha!Isha.Why did you leave me?You ask me to face the truthbut you decided to run away?Nalini told me somethingwas going to happen on stage.Didn't Ronit call you to the stage?Did he call you? Tell me.I left before he could do that.Why, dear?Remember you used to say...a girl who is not acceptedby the family...finds it very difficult to get respect.There's more to life than romantic love,there are other relationships...like aunt, sister-in-law, daughter-in-law.My dear!For the first time,I've seen the worldthrough the eyes of my children.We rise in life, yet we are so petty.And I sunk to such depthsthat I cannot ask to be forgiven.But I do want you...to marry into my family.If you do...I will know I've been forgiven.Go.He has come to take you away.Go.Thank you, Jagdish.Raj Singh's story doesn't end here.He stayed a friend to the children,till the very end,even when he became a grandfather.Supriya.Supriya!Where are you, Supriya?Supriya will go for a walk with me.Then she'll return home.Then she will exercise.Later, she will have a bath and pray.After that I'll take her to school.And in the evening, we'll go out.-Where are you, dear?-I'm here, grandpa.My beautiful baby.Where is Avantika, your mother?Everyone has gone out, left me.Mother, father, uncle, aunt.Everyone left you, but I'm with you.-Your grandpa.-Grandpa, will you be my best friend?You mean friend-grandpa?Dear, did you hear that?Look at this.She too...All right, dear. Give me your hand.From today, I'm your friend-grandpa.Let's go. Wait a minute.First let me take the keys.What do you want to ask?Grandpa, when did my parents get married?Six years ago.-Uncle Ronit and Aunt Isha?-Four years ago.When are you getting me married?Tell me! Please!There are songsThere are complaintsThere are stories and promisesThere are songsThere are complaintsThere are stories and promisesWords are forgottenNot the memoriesWords are forgottenNot the memoriesMemoriesMemoriesMemoriesTranslated by:Saurabh R Sawant
