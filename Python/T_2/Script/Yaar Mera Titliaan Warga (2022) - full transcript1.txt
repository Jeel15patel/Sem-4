I saw in the mobile.How they keep their wiveshappy through internet.How?- This is a mall.- Okay.All the immoral relationsstart from here.- Is it?- Yes.You just look carefullywhat happens in the city.And how married men stay happy.- Yes.- Look there.That man is holding hands of his wifebut is looking at someone else.Doesn't the wife notice?These men show so much lovethat the wife can't even imaginethat her husband is cheating on her.All right then...Only God knows whatwill happen to this world.Just keep watchingand you will be astonished.Look there.Look there. He is giving flying kiss.Shall we go that side?Oh, God...Doesn't he feel ashamed?That's how theirrelationships are saved.They've all the fun outsidethe house and once in the house,they just concentrateon keeping the wives happy.And we are worried about petty issues.People are so lucky tobe surrounded by so much beauty.That is why this iscalled a mall (Beautiful).There is so much beauty here.One should just know howto capture the beautiful birds.Government has done a very good job.First they just made bridges andpeople used to go on bridges and fall.Only thing we need is mallsjust like this one.After 5-7 years of marriage,just like a dead battery.There is nothing wrong.You just have to chargeit by an external wire.And then you can run the motor.Sema, Gurmel Singh Gelawill go further than a batteryand become a solar system.

Did it get disconnected?- Yes.- Why did you get sister-in-law, here?Because that's what city people do.They bring their wives withthem but look at other women.The men from the city bring their wivesbecause their wives donot allow them to come alone.So they have no other option.You could have come alone and enjoyed.Okay. From tomorrow I willcome alone and leave Beant at home.But now looking them fromdistance is not enough for me.What do you want?I want to make a friendwith whom I can talk my heart out.- And love her.- Stay away.I asked you to get batterycharged from outside.And you want to get other's batteries.Women in city are very smart.If they reach your housethe Beant would thrash you.She wouldn't thrash me.She is very simple.We keep a third spare wheel on scooter,although it needs only two to run.In case if one gets flat.Sister-in-law does not get flat.You cannot predict a good or a bad time.We should be ready with an option.Nowadays there aredual sim mobiles as well.If one does not workthen talk from the other one.Have you seen yourself in the mirror?A city girl would noteven keep a driver like you.And you want to be a friend.Rascal, do you have any stand or not?Yesterday,you were saying that times have changedand today you are shatteringmy courage, idiot.How will you get close to any girl?We do not even know how toaddress a girl by saying excuse me.Sema, is he the same manwho was with his wife yesterdayand was wooing other girls.He is the same.He seems to have completecontrol on the mall.Miss Afsana has sunga song for people like him.Sometimes on this flowerand sometimes on the other..."Yaar Mera Titliyan Warga"(my lover is like a butterfly).Lets do one thing.We'll keep a watch on himand learn how he impresses the girls.We'll follow his every move.- He is going out.- Let's go then.What about Beant?I need to thank her saying thatthe time we spend together was good.Now the time hascome to put the stepney.- Come on.- Looks like Beant's time is over.He wants to put stepney.Keep the veil inside.Take this and drop them carefully.But suddenly what happened? Tell me.Our scooter does not havea stepney so I am going to get that.Okay, get it. Sometimesthe scooter does get punctured.That is why I am trying to arrange one.Go. Okay.He is leaving.Let's follow him.Okay, then.Bye. I will leave now.- Take care.- Bye.What time will you be back?I have a meeting in officeso will be a little late.- Okay, no problem.- Okay.- Sonu.- Yes?- He is leaving.- Come on.- Hi.- Hello.- Come, please.- Thank you.- Is she the same one?- Yes.To whom he was giving signals.She is whitish like milk.Hurry up.Come on.Greetings.- Greetings.- Greetings.Why did the boy take the girl inside?If we started telling it,we'll go out of business.Can we go inside and see a bit?You don't seem bitty type.- We want to drink tea.- Yes.The cost of tea is 250 rupees inside.There is a freshfruit juice stall there.You get a glass of fresh fruitfor 40 rupees. Go.Wouldn't there be crowd hereif anything was visible?Sema, he took her inside.And his wife thinksthat her husband is at work.And he is enjoying.Did you get a fit whilewriting our destiny?Don't curse God.Otherwise, he might takeback the little He has given you.Take back if you want.What will you have, brother?At this moment, all I have is patience.- We'll call you back for order.- Okay.You will not be able to do such things.The hotel staff willstop you at the gate.They will send the girl insideand you'll again be left outside.Once I have a girlfriend,I would cross the Wagah(Pakistan) border for her.Entering the hotelwon't be a problem whatsoever.There is a big problem.These girls become friendsonly with handsome boys.Out of pity someone may shake handswith you. Rest seems difficult for you.Nothing is difficult, Sema.Let them come out.Then I am going to fall athis feet and make him may master.And I am going to learnand grasp all his knowledge.- Listen to me. Listen to me.- Why did you come here?You lied to me so thatyou could enjoy with her?What are you doing with her?Do you think you will be happyafter creating problems in my family?I'll show you.- Listen to me.- What should I listen to you?Leave me. What are you doing?- What were you doing?- We came here for lunch.- Let me feed you Dosa, you bitch.- Leave me.- What are you doing, Dear?- Call her dear not me.Why did you bring her here?You lied to me.- We had come here for lunch.- What are you doing?- Listen to me.- Tell.- We had come here for lunch.- I will teach you...Let me see how you come home, rascal.Ultimately,you'll have to come back to me.What are you looking at, brother?This happens every day.Every day 5-6 husbands are thrashed.But the husbands are so stubbornthat they still do not stop. Yes.It depends on the wife.If your wife is goodthen she can explain nicely.A wife may be simple and innocentbut after seeing suchacts even she would get wild.In this life you adjust with Beant.Who knows what will Godmake us in the next birth?Let's put in extra effort in this life.So, you are ready to get thrashed.If nobody succeeded,no one would even try.You used to say that personwith extramarital affairalways keep his wife happy.You mean to say that Ican never be happy in marriage.There must be some way out.- Yes, there is.- What?Have you heard about Facebook?Yes, where boys and girls dance.- Even old people are on it now.- Really?They have reignited theirold affairs through it.Okay.This is the easiestway to find a girlfriend.Do you have 4,000 rupees?Yes, but I have to pay the bill.You can pay the bill later,first let me buy you a mobile.Yes, come.Here it is, with the cover.- This is great. Give him the money.- Yes.- Okay, thank you.- Okay, bye.I've no money left.You cannot enjoy without spending.You'll feel like thatyou are in a carnival.Really?Gurmel, your Facebookaccount has been opened.Whose photo should I put?You made me spend 4,000 rupeesthen it is obvious you willput my photo and not that of neighbors.Look at yourself. Forget girls, evenboys won't accept your friend request.No one puts their ownphoto to do wrong things.- Then?- You can get trapped as well.We shall put photographof a handsome boy.While his photo will attract girls.You'll remain safe.Hey, you.
