Do you?I don't know. When my brotherwas ill he said he saw angels.How did he know they were angels?I don't know, but I believed him.He died after all.People don't liebefore they die.Saratov, you believed me!I never had a brother.- Maybe you never had a dog either.- No, I did have a dog.Why did she tell me that story?Maybe it was her who saw the angels.I don't know.I heard the pipesand I thought about the hospital.Where I lay all day inbed without moving.I was alonewith my thoughts.I told them I didn't need drugs.I told them to leave me alone.They wouldn't listen.They injected so much rubbish.How could I remember anythingif they kept giving me drugs?I only remembered how it felt.There was no pain at first.Then, everything inside exploded.When I woke upI was even scared to move.I knew I had to try harder.Try to be like I was before.A normal guy from Saratov.I needed her.I wanted her to be next to me again.Although all the world was spinningand I did not know how to stop it.Do you want the bike?What bike?Your mate Bob's.It's in the garage.Take it and leave me the address.- Don't tell me you don't recognize me.- You know what its like, bitch.- It's me, Kozyr!- I can see who it is.- They treat me like a shit!- I'll slice your throat.- Without a bike I'm nothing!- Shut your trap.What are you doin'?Saratov!Let him go.- What?- Let him go and hand over your bike.- The address!- Well, good for you.The address!I forgot it,I promise I'll getit to you today.Don't worry about the bike,he'll bring it back.I know Kozyr.He and I were at school together.- He can't even drive.- He'll be alright.- I only did it because you asked.- Thanks.What's going on?Are you crazy? Everyone's asleep.Relax, your grandfather's half deaf.Go away.Don't worry, I won't touch you.I only want to lie beside you...just so we can talk.It's impossible.When, then?In three days' time.Go away!I'm not leaving.Go to bed!I heard she's not letting you in!She won't give it to you.She's just like her grandmother.She was a crazy woman.She wouldn't let me touch herfor thirty years! Terrible!She hated sleeping with men.Do you understandwhat her heredity is?Drop her to hell!Find yourself a normal one...Go home, you're upsetting him.Come back! I lovedthat crazy woman.She's been dead a long time,and I want to die too.Zhenya!Zhenya, what happened?You've been with that gang again.The police called.Mum, shut the door and go to bed.What's going to become of usin this awful neighbourhood?In this awful house?I found a knuckledusterin your pocket.Why do you need a knuckleduster?You could be arrested for that.Why did you go through my pockets?I don't like it.Just put it back and don't worry.I thought you would havea normal life.When you were little and we livedin the center of Moscow...we walked in the Hermitagegardens every day.Everybody who saw you said to me,"What a beautiful little boy!"I thought you'd have a normal life.A normal life? What's a normal life?Our life?It's not normal.We never lived a normal life.You're all I have...I brought you up without a father.I thought you'd be my little prince...and that everything wouldturn out all right.Everything will be all right,you'll see.After Kozyr leftshe told me that I wasthe first guy who helped her.I knew she needed me.I felt good.I decided that nightwhen everything is doneto ask herto come with me back to Saratov.Wait.I've some business to attend to.I'll see you later.Saratov...Will you really come back?I told you, I'll see you tonight.- Is there something wrong?- No, everything's fine.Why doesn't she believe me?I told her I would be back.I think she wantedto ask something else.She is afraid.I can't tell her everything.Mansour gave me an address.I have to be readyfor the meeting tonight.- What do you need?- A gun.- When?- Tonight.I need a gun at 9 tonight.Mansour called me.He asked if you were here yet.Phone him in Saratov.I love boxing!There is nothing better for me.I dream about boxing at night.My wife's afraid to sleep with me.You know...I hit her in my sleep once.Look at them.Watch him.He is a topnotch boxer.If I work with him,he will have a mortal blow.Do you see?

We're good.Understand?She's crazy, just like her brother.Three months agoher brother cut his wrists.When she entered the room,she saw a pool of blood on the floor.He was already dead.After thatshe began to sleep in this basement.Saratov, did you really believedthat he was my brother?I thought thatI had to get the money, and thenI would have had plenty of timeto go and look for her.Where are you going?- I'm heading south.- It's a long road.You gotta pay.I know.Get in.It's a long way and no one cantake away this air of freedomI went with God because Iwanted to fight for freedomI was killed in the burning fightDisappeared like smokein the fireMama, don't cry,I fought for youNow the blackbird screechesAnd pecks at my open mouthThey stabbed me in the backAnd my jacket is ripped open- Yes.- It's me, Bob.Are you back in Saratov?No, I'm still in Moscow.Why are you still in Moscow?I'm waiting for the money.Did you find him?Yes.You got the money?No.- Did you kill him?- No.Why?He asked for one more day.I told you that if he didn't give youthe money you had to kill him.He'll give it to me tonight.He'll never give you the money,you little fuck.You should have killed him.I thought the most importantwas to take the money.I'll take care of it.- Who is it?- It's me.You said you'd be here at 10.What happened?I was busy.Where's the money?- How much is there?- 70,000.Where's the rest?There's a guy coming.Don't worry, it'll be here.I told you to have it ready.It's not so easy.The rest will be here soon.Relax, have a drink.Here's to our town champion!- Do you still wrestle?- No.Too bad none of us lotstayed in the sport.- Come on, let's drink to us.- That's enough.Where's this guy?Wait another 10 minutes.I do not want to risk.I want to go back to Saratov.I haven't been there for a year.I'm sick of hiding out here.If I give him back the money...I have nothing to fear, right?I returned the debt.- Have you seen my wife?- I saw her.Have you seen her around town?Not very often.Once a month? Once a week?That's enough, Valera.I've been thinking...thank God he sent you.Another guy wouldn't have given mea second chance. I'm lucky.That'll be him.Hello!That's the rest.You may count them.Get him in the car.Yes, we were the best teamthere was.Good fellas. So energetic.Remember the championship?I was already far away.Far away from the painfrom the gun,and the city going by the window...We could've been good together.We had to go to that place.Everything was waiting for us there.I would build a little house.I would make a stove to be warm.It's funny...but I can remember itso clearly now...Do you hear me?I asked you how many timesyou saw her out.Go fuck yourself.Answer nicely. How many times?Tell me exactly.Valera, the guy doesn'tfeel like talking.Watch the road, this is my business.It's my business when you startacting crazy.Everything's fine now.She forgot him the minute he left.Everyone in Saratov knew it.I should have killed you.Your knees were shaking too much.I made a big mistake.We didn't need that fucking money.And Valera will be killedby the next guy,that the boss will send.I know that I was happy.It was not long, but...but maybe that's all that I'd ever be.Get out.He's had enough.On your feet.Listen, the railway stationis over there.Go back to your fucking Saratov.Moscow's not for you. Got it?Valera...This guy understands everything.Right, go on then.Tell those shits tostay away from me.The next guywon't be let off so lightly.Go!Move!Go on! Get lost, Saratov!I'll say hello to your wifefor you when I see her.Where is she?She didn't believe me.I should have told her everything.
