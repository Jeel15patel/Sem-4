A TOHO PRESENTATIONThis is great.Your kid's going to love it.Where'd you buy it?At the Marukoshi department store.My son found it.He's been begging me to get itfor a while now.But it's quite expensive.It is?That's not good.Mr. Kawashima, do you have anykids who'd like this toy?I do. One of them is stillcrawling around.I have 7 kids, after all.


Must be a handful!They're going to be the death of me.I always tell this to my boys:"Don't become a cop.""If you do,you'll end up as an old man whocan't do enough for his kids."And I tell my girls this:"Don't marry a cop.""He'll get paid peanuts, have to puthis life on the line,and once he gets to retirement age,that'll be all she wrote."They certainly take after me though.One of my boys will be 9 this year.And whenever he plays cops androbbers at school,he's always the sheriff.


The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.Here are your drinks!Mr. Okada.Huh?THE BEAST SHALL DIEProduction:Sanezumi Fujimoto, Masakatsu KanekoOriginal Novel: Haruhiko OyabuScreenplay: Yoshio ShirasakaCinematography: Fukuzo KoizumiArt Direction: Kyoe HamagamiLighting: Norikazu IndaMusic: Toshiro MayuzumiAssistant Director: Ken SanoEditing: Reiko KanekoAudio Recording: Toshiya BanCASTTatsuya NakadaiHiroshi KoizumiReiko DanYumi ShirakawaMakoto SatoEiko MiyoshiIchiro ShimizuYoshio ShirasakaNobuo NakamuraEijiro TonoYusuke TakitaToru TakeuchiHaruya KatoNadao KirinoAkira SeraTetsu NakamuraKenzo TabuAkira TaniYutaka SadaMichiyo YokoyamaAkiko WakabayashiIchiro ChibaDirected by:Eizo SugawaEven though they failed in changingthe Police Security Act,the reactionary cabinet is eager toreform the Security Treaty.Allowing foreign troops to stay inJapan and announcing joint defensemeans turning Japan into another Manchuria,and placing it under the completecontrol of the US.As long as there are basesused by foreign troops,Japan cannot escape becoming abattleground for foreign nations.We must now, above all else,mobilize our energies to oppose therevision of the security treaty.They're at it again.The Philosophy Society.Well, that's part of theirjob hunting campaign.From leafleting to office work.If all goes well,from delegate to leftist secretary.Know why young assistant professorsuse so much flattery with these people?Students know that even if theygraduate a university like ours,they can only hope to becomelow-paid salarymen.That's why they look to social justiceto vent their frustrations.So, the assistant professorssuck up to them,which makes them popular lecturers,and increases the number of applications.Having a large numberof seminar applicationsis the only thing justifyingtheir existence as scholars.By the time they become professorsand gain confidence in themselves,they won't be using flattery anymore.In other words, Marxist social theoryis just a way to put food on the table.Only the stupidly honest will get brandedas reds and lose their jobs.They're all hopeless!I'm Tezuka, 4th year in Western Philosophy.I was given this.Oh, you.Come on now, you really need to pay.Did you bring your tuition?No.You'll be expelled if you don't pay up soon.- But...- Rules are rules.I'm Date, grad student in literature.Right.Majoring in American literature.Everything paid for this month.If you don't pay by the end of themonth, you'll really be expelled.Got it?Professor.Can a robotic, truly ruthless personalityonly come from a mechanisticsociety like the US?Yeah, you could say that.As you said,criminals in Japan aremore or less emotional.Japan has a small land mass andan unnecessarily large population.Love affairs, resentment, finances.They commit crimes with petty,humanistic motives.So they easily get caught.Each one has a plausiblesob story reason for it."That's understandable.""I feel sorry for them."There's nothing hard-boiled about it.I'm sorry I'm late.Have a seat here.I wonder, though.I still can't get over it.When I came back from America,I was appalled.Japanese society is like a putrid trash can.And that's the kind of society that Ibelieve will breed new criminals.Think about it. Suicide and murderare the only achievable heroic acts- for modern-day Japanese youth.- You could say that.Then, say petty crimesevolve into murdering for fun.An aberrant person who killsbecause he wants to kill -that is, who derives the greatestpleasure from the thrill of the kill -might plan a perfect crime andsucceed in making a fortune,all while smiling and appearingto be a model citizen.What would you do if a personlike that appeared, Taeko?I'd fall in love.Let's return to this issue next time.My car's here, so I'll be going now.I've been busy these days.University professor, scholar of Americanliterature, social critic, and...Media darling.He must really be raking it in.Do you know how a man with noacademic accomplishmentscould achieve what he has today?I do.He married the granddaughter of GoroKuga, he of a Meiji era conglomeratethat invested heavily inthis university's founding.There's that too.But the biggest reason is that hestudied in America for 5 years."I really noticed this in America."I really noticed this in America.Time is money.It's simple, but it's the truth.I'm terribly sorry.I had a flat tire on the way here.Fortunately, the seminar went long,otherwise I'd havelost 20 minutes of my life.Seeing as how you're so busy,it must be hard also teaching the seminar.It's my responsibility andobligation as a professor.I'm willing to put in the work,for the sake of the students.So what's the theme of today'sroundtable discussion?American politics and literature.You'll have me out of there by 6:00,won't you?I have an interview with Radio Japan.Professor.I'll have that translation toyou by tonight.All right.Let me introduce you.This is Mr. Yamamoto of theWeekly World.Mr. Date, from my research lab.Nice to meet you.If you've any translation work,please pass it on to him.- I can vouch for his work.- I see.I look forward to it.- I'll be off.- All right.He's very talented.Unfortunately, he's poor.To help with money,I'm giving him somepart-time translation work.I take good care of my students.Oh?Bullseye!Date, what a shot!Right on target.Another bullseye!Your turn.Really?I'm leaving.I don't know if I can follow that.But I came to this universitybecause it had a shooting club.Even if I graduate andeventually find a job,my monthly salary will be 10,200 yen.Get used, ordered around,never become an executive,and then retire before evenmaking enough in savings.Let's at least get our frustrationsout by shooting.Nope.You're way off.Hurry up!Stay back!- Come on!- Stay back!Stop pushing.I said stop pushing!Stop pushing!Take a good look.You never know when you'll end up like that.Hey, must be out of his mindto kill a police detective.- This guy'll get caught in no time.- I wonder.The police are pretty useless lately.You can't make much doing part-timetranslation for Professor Sugimura.They take so much off the top.Why did you take a job like that?Rather than having such a low-paying job,it'd be smarter to enter theWorld Student Essay Contestsponsored by America's Ridgeway Foundation.The top 3 places will get to studyabroad at Harvard University.But what's the use studying abroad ifyou don't have the money, right?In other news, at around2:30 this morningMetropolitan Police Detective SusumuOkada was found shot dead in the trunkof a Chevrolet car abandoned on the roadin Nakameguro District, Meguro Ward.Based on the M.O. andidentity of Mr. Okada,the crime is being investigated asthe act of a professional criminalor an ex-con with a grudge.Can I come over to your apartment next time?Today in Tokyo, 35 fires brokeout, including those...It's like we just come here to get it overwith and then leave. I don't like that.Where's your apartment?I'm moving soon.I'll help you move.What's gotten into you all of a sudden?Hold on.Let's call it quits after tonight.Don't be silly.You promised from the beginningto not get too attached.You're serious?If word starts getting around at school,it'll be bad for both of us.And you're going to get marriedsomeday, aren't you?I don't want to lose theprofessors' trust, either.Why did you approach me then?If sex was all you wanted,you could've gone to anynumber of prostitutes.You're terrible.Don't be so cruel.Guys like you always...Fine.Let's break up.Now let me go.Please.Hey...Stop!This is our last time.Get off me!What was the cause of death?The autopsy revealed thathe died instantly from a gunshotwound to the heart.The bullet was crushed beyond recognition,but is estimated to be 22-caliber.22-caliber is what they use atthe National Defense University.Was it stolen from the University?Was it one of the students?Is that the lead you're pursuing?Furthermore, the fingerprintsleft on the car are nowbeing checked in the labwith those of ex-convicts.And given the nature of the case,I'm moving the investigation to Police HQ.And that's about it.Moving to HQ will take a while, won't it?What's the timeline?- What have you come up with so far?- We're waiting on results from the lab.Investigations are about science,and science is the best. That's my motto.We aren't Zenigata Heiji orDenshichi of Kuromoncho.We're in the Metropolitan Police Dept.,the pinnacle of modern science.Police StationInvestigations are about intuition.Experience.You can't just rely on science.Be it intuition or science,the important partis finding the murderer as soon as possible.Even if we find him,it won't bring back the dead.What are Okada's wife and childgoing to do without him?I just remembered.- Remembered what?- I need to make a call.To who?I'd made plans with my fiancée.I suppose they're ruined now.Where's your fiancée at this time of night?At a Western-style cafe.It's a kind of bar.She's working there.You can't let her do that.You can't leave her there withso many temptations.You should get married soon.Getting married doesn't putfood on the table.And who knows if I'llend up like Mr. Okada.You said so yourself.It's cruel to suggest marriage knowing that.You just have to figure out this part?Yes.Japanese specialties, huh?A Japanese specialty with 4 characters.There's geisha, Mt. Fuji...- How about bushido?- That doesn't fit.It's 4 characters, right?What do you think?Any ideas?Corruption, poverty, tuberculosis, flooding.- The bill.- Okay.Thank you very much.There's plenty of bad ones.Typhoons. Floods. Fires.Breach of trust. Embezzlement.Hooliganism. Murder.Detective brutally murdered in the line of duty.Dead in the trunk of a luxury car.Yoko, the phone.Thanks.Your boyfriend?Guess what her boyfriend does for work.Another quiz?He's a police detective.A detective?Oh, wow!So, I can't make it tonight.I'll call you again next time.Really?I was really looking forward to it.Well, what can you do?Don't catch a cold.Thanks. Bye now.17 on black.17 on black.A winner.Betting closed.25 on red.25 on red.A big winner.Paid Parking AreaMetropolitan Police Dept.You're under arrest for unlawful gambling.Tetsu, call my lawyer.You can't arrest someone unlessthey're caught in the act.Do you have a warrant?You bastard!Listen up.Tell yourself the following:"I screwed up bad and got caught.""But the detective who picked me upwants some spending money.""He says he won't tell anyone aboutthe gambling as long asI keep my mouth shut.""I'm simply one ofMr. Regan's expendables.""I'll give this detective some moneyas a token of my friendship.""If I don't give him the moneyand I snitch on him,then this youngsterwill tear me apart."Yes, keep telling yourself that.You're just a back-alley rat too.I'm sure you know what you're doing.All right, it's decided.It's time for a little nap.STUDY ABROAD APPLICATION:[1] Faculty: Modern American Literature(Kanto University Graduate program)[2] Name: Kunihiko Date[3] Address: Ikebukuro, Tokyo[4] Age: 26 years oldAlright!Ow! Ow!It's just a scratch.It's just a crack in the skull.If it hurts,you'll inject this, won't you?You've got a lot of it around, right?You really screwed up.It's none of my business,but who is this guy?He said he was a cop,but I think he's a phony.How are you going to fix this?If Mr. Regan in Manila hears about this,it won't be good.I know that.Hey, Tetsu.Yasu, find that bastard as soon as possible.Put him to sleep.I think he's a fake, but let's checkwith the cops just in case...You go a long way back with Pei, don't you?(Speaking Chinese)Popular stocks this afternoon includeNoda Soy Sauce and Kyowa Hakko.New highs for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries?- Fine day today, isn't it?- Indeed it is.I'll be moving out by the end of this month.- Really?- Thank you for everything.Where are you off to next?I found a very cheap house outside the city.Getting married, are you now?I am.Bye now.Mr. Date's getting married?I wonder what she's like.He's an earnest, handsome young man.She must be a beauty.- This car ran great.- Reliability is our top priority.6000 yen.I'll rent again soon.Oh, thank you very much.Take care.- Name's Date.- Yes.Okay.Thank you very much.In the month since the murder,we've learned only 3 things.First, the weapon used wasa SW automatic pistol, apparently stolenfrom the National Defense University.Second, all the fingerprintsbelonged to the owner ofthe stolen Chevrolet.Meaning no prints were left by the murderer.Third, the Hillman themurderer used afterwardwas found abandoned in Tadanobaba.It's unclear where he went next.Gentlemen, one of your owncolleagues was murdered.We have to catch him nomatter what. For Okada.Anyhow, this guy's quiteintelligent, isn't he?Just a hunch.Forget your hunch.Investigations are a science.Now's the time to mobilize thefull power of science,and respond in good faith to the needsof the taxpaying public.Do you understand?Murder InvestigationMr. Kawashima. Any leads?- Nope.- That's no good.Unlike the others, we've beenfollowing this from the start,so we look bad if nothing comes of it.We're the ones who'll look bad.The chief is getting hysterical.If nothing comes of the story,then it's all on me.The editor's already breathingdown my neck. It's terrible.Just me give a line.Something, anything!Sorry.Hey, think you could help?- Investigations are a science, apparently.- Huh?Since the public is paying their taxes.Finally, something I can use.Wow, your line of destiny looks promising.You'll meet a rich, handsome, generous man.- Really?- Me!Good evening.Highball.You'll have to excuse me.We're going dancing, right?- Right.- Good, I'll be waiting.How rare.No one got killed today?You finish early, right?Let's go home together.Oh? You should really giveme more notice.Why?I already made plans.With a customer.- Just turn them down.- I can't do that.The owner gets upset if we'retoo cold to our customers.You should quit a place like this.Quit and do what?You think I'll find a half decent jobas a high school drop out?You sure you can marry me andsupport me financially?There'll be kids sooner or later, too.Some flowers for the lady?No, thank you.Listen.Could you perhaps just telephone,and not come to the bar?What?I'm happy to see you,but it causes me trouble.I mean, people make fun of me forhaving a detective boyfriend.Yoko.It doesn't matter to me whatbusiness you're in.But you don't want to make thingsawkward for me, do you?I'll buy your flowers.I'll buy all of them.How much?Lady, how much do you make doing this?Barely anything.I'll buy them, so drink.Right?Drink up.Hey, lady.Want to make a little more money?Come on and sing.Sing.If you sing, I'll give you all of this.But... I mean,what do you want me to sing?Anything you want.Something lively.Oh, and dance too.Dance while you sing.All this.The stars know everything.The stars know...Come on, that's enough!...everything.Come on, dance!Dance, lady!The girl's...The cute girl's dull eyes...Dull eyes...La-la!La-la-la-la-la!La-la-la-la!What's with that guy?I don't know.He comes here sometimes.Always alone.La-la-la-la-la!La-la-la-la-la!La-la-la-la-la-la-la!- That's enough, don't you think?- The poor lady.Please stop.You're going to ruin the mood.What the hell?- He's an asshole.- What a creep!Oh, Vreneli, please tell me.Oh, where is your home?My home, it is Switzerland...I'm just an intern right now, but comeApril I'll be an official employee.You should come for a visit sometime.What are you going to doif you fail your finals?You think the school's going to faila student with an offer already?Well, then.Must be nice having connections.We don't have any.And we can't play baseball, rugby,or swim. We've got it the worst.Do you have the money to study abroad?I'll make it work. Even if I have towork as a dishwasher there.Regardless, you should submit yourmaster's thesis as soon as possible.I'm sure you'll get in withyour grades as they are,but it's just a matter of the money.- These, right?- Yes.And I'd like you to do atranslation of this.All right.The guy at the publishing company saidthe books are selling well under my name.The company knows that you're involved.How dishonest.I'm glad to be of service.Also...Right.Your paper from the other day.What was the title again?Brutality in Modern Human Beings.Right, right, that one.It was well-received at the faculty meeting.I'm thinking of submitting it to theRidgeway Foundation Contest.If you win, you'll get ascholarship to Harvard.However, there are so many excellentpapers from around the world.So the odds are awfully low.There's no need to rely on it, of course.But only in the sense that it would makeyour application more impressive.Come in.I'm Endo from the Chuo Times.I just called.Please have a seat.Thanks.You're a social critic with a deepappreciation for hard-boiled literature,so I'd like to ask your opinion on thedetective's murder the other day.A detective was murdered?Pardon?I've been so busythat I've only read the politicalpages of the newspapers.Do you know about it?Me?Yes, roughly.Then, you should say something in my place.This is Date, a student of mine.Hello.There are two opposing factions in thepolice right now. Science and intuition.That's what I hear.Be it science or intuition,solving modern-day murdercases will prove difficultunless they alter theirfundamental way of thinking.And by that you mean?It's a single-minded approachlacking imagination.I think it's a mistake to assume thatthe detective's murder was the work ofa yakuza or a professional.I see.You can put that in the paperas coming from me.I'll include your photo too.Oh, really?And?Salarymen, students, laborers.Every city right now is full of peoplewho could kill at any moment.With anger towards this twisted society...The pain of not being ableto trust people...The dark shadows of whattheir futures may hold...Reason and common sense areall that's holding them back.Who knows when they'll give themselves overto the so-called heroic act of murder.I completely agree.At times I've even had thosekinds of urges myself.If I was going to kill,I'd start with my editor.He's a pompous jerk.He says, "Write, write!"I mean, I'm not a machine.No, I won't kill him though.I won't kill him.Go on.As proof, the nature of murders isbeginning to change at a frightening rate."I don't like the look he gave,so I'll kill him.""She had pretty lips, so I'll kill her."From the gruff old police's viewpoint,these are murders committedseemingly at random.That's why they're bewildered.Due to their preconceptions,they can't find the murderer.The problem is, society is creating newmurders, and new criminals.And...In the face of a true pioneer,their single-minded investigationwill be blown to pieces.Thank you for your time today.Thanks to you,I'll be able to write a good articlethat should pacify my editor for a bit.I won't have to kill him now.Go, Oki!Umino!Let's go!We'd now like to announce thewinnings for the 7th race.2510 yen for the combination of #3 and #4.In first place is #5 for 250 yen.In second is #8 for 390 yen.In third is #1 for 170 yen.Hello.We met at school.Remember me from the accounts office?Right.I was way off today.But next time'll be different.I think it's either 2:1 or the reverse.You're a man.How about placing a big bet?I don't even have enoughmoney left for dinner.It happens.Don't get discouraged.But I still feel the next one's a sure bet.Champion Noodles: 200 yenTuberculosis can be cured, right?If you have money.Why not stay in the hospital?I couldn't bear that,living in a sanatorium.Well, let's get some nutrients in you.Hey.Bring us some fuyo hai or something.What's fuyo hai?- Fried egg and crab.- Can't make that.- What can you make?- Dumplings or Soba.Okay, two orders of each.Two dumplings and two ramen.Oh, and beer.And one bottle of beer!What happened with your tuition?I can't afford it, so I'm goingto get kicked out.They couldn't figure something out?Universities are businesses, after all.They don't want to deal withthose who can't pay.What about your parents?Mom died from tuberculosis soonafter giving birth to me.And Dad was the assistant managerof our local bank,but he jumped from thebank's rooftop two years ago.Why?Dad used to be the chairmanof the bank's labor union.Back then, he collected about 1 billion yenin deposits from various unionsin the prefecture.He brought in more customersthan big corporations.So despite being a red, he was promoted.That was almost 10 years ago,when deposits were hard to come by.But,after exploiting him for all his worth,the bank tried ousting himin every way possible.He was a red, after all.He had a nervous breakdown.And then committed suicide.The bank sent me flowers.A big wreath of them.Well, have a drink.Okay.But...But?Why are you being so nice to me?First, for some reason I'vetaken a liking to you.Second, my dad killed himself too.What?But the races won't pay your tuitionor cure your tuberculosis.Anyway, here's to gettingto know each other.I keep getting the feeling that theperp's someone unexpected.A hunch?Hunches are off limits, you know.The chief's gonna yell at you.Even if you investigate the yakuza, theirformer drivers, or the illegal possession...It's like looking for a needlein a haystack. It's pointless.I wonder.Don't you think we should lookat things from a new angle?What do you mean by "someone unexpected"?Not a yakuza or ex-con or anything,but say, an earnest student, ora hardworking businessman.Or even a rookie detective.Hey, hey.I mean, there are times when evenI feel like killing someone.What are you saying?In this world, it's always thehonest who end up losing.They can never get a break.You're just riled up.You haven't seen your girlfriend in a while.You'll feel better after seeing her again.- I can't.- Why not?Apparently everyone laughs when theyhear she's dating a detective.We work so hard to keep the peace.And what do we get for it?Like you, Mr. Kawashima.You're a poor old guy who can't evenbuy what he wants for his kids.So what are you going to do?Kill someone?Kill someone and head to death row?Unfortunately, I'm not capable of that.I'm just saying that there are a lot ofpeople out there who think like that.Ah, there you are.Did you read the evening edition?No.I thought I'd try to go bigwith the article.It was supposed to just be a fillerinterview, but it turned out great.What do ya think?Not groundbreaking or revolutionary,but pretty smart, right?That's interesting.I just heard the same opinion from him.Really?Give it a look.To be honest, it's not actuallyProfessor Sugimura's theory,but one of his student's.He's a very gifted student.Almost certainly studying in the US.If Mr. Masugi has the same opinion,then I guess it's generational.I suppose...I can't understand it.It just gives me the chills.I understand it.The entrance exam war's upon us.This year's average enrollment rate foreach faculty is 1/30 students.And with some bribing theirway in it's even harder.The exam fees alone are staggering.Then tuition on top of that.What's the school going to dowith all that money?Is Mr. Date here today?He hasn't come in for some time.He's probably home working onhis thesis or a translation.Apparently, Date's paper was ahit at the faculty meeting.Yeah, I heard.What kind of paper?Modern age is a time of chaos,madness and contradiction,so in order to confront it, we have nochoice but to show our beastly nature.It's nothing special, really.He's saying to become a beast and do what?Murder for profit, for instance.Christianity's notion about the sanctityof life is utterly wrong.In this day and age,people are like insects.Human will and liberty are just hindrancesin the complex machinery of the modern age.But isn't discovering liberty withinthe chaos and contradictionwhat humans do in life?That argument's making quite a leap.This isn't me saying this.It's Date's paper.Who are you?Where's Date's apartment?I don't know... do you?No.He isn't a very sociable guy.No one really knows him well.Taeko might know.Right.Taeko was just here.She's in Medicine, I think.Is she really going to do that job?Taeko Kusumi, right?Can I ask you a few questionsabout Kunihiko Date?I've got to get to work.Can you keep it short?Where do you think I can find him?I don't know.I'm not his guardian.If he's not at shooting practice or driving,then maybe the boxing club?- His residence?- Don't know.He won't tell me.I'm sure the school's office orhis professors would know.What kind of person is Date?Who knows.In TrainingCould you please tell meeverything you know?He's a man who's never with awoman more than 3 times.What?He's the kind of guy thatonce he's accomplished andsaved up enough moneymarries a pretty girl who lacks enoughbrains to give herself a headache.Come on in.Are you getting scared?This isn't for women.You'll faint.Mortuary RoomWhat kind of job is this?Taking the alcohol-soaked cadaversused in med school autopsies,and transferring them to new tanks.What?It pays extremely well.And I need the money.Hustle, hustle!Right, right, right.Come on, come on!Come on, watch your footwork.Hit him.Ah, it's no use.Is Mr. Date of Kanto University here?Huh?He's over there.You idiot!Mr. Date.I'm with the police,and I saw your article in thepaper the other day.And I share the same opinion.Please.I've actually seen you once before.At Rollita.That woman selling flowerswas really unpleasant.Ah, that old lady?Appealing to people's sentimentalityfor profit is despicable.Don't you think so?Yeah, I suppose.I don't like things likesentimentality, emotion, or mood.You don't have anything likethat in your life?No, I don't.You can't survive in today'ssociety if you do.Why don't you have a seat?Must feel good doing sports.Feels great.I hear you're in the shooting club?I can kill in one shot, eyes closed.Do you have a car?Do you have a license?Are you from the census?It comes with the job.In this line of work, I tend to ask questionsthat make people uncomfortable.- Sorry about that.- I don't mind.I envy you.Huh?The fact that you could throw that kindof money at the flower lady.That was part of my savings to study abroad.- Study abroad?- Yeah.I got permission.Should be able to go in the spring.You made all that money working part-time?You can investigate if you're uncertain.I wonder if that'll be necessary.If you want to waste taxpayer money.Taxpayer money is wasted regardless.That's good.About that article.I agree with your opinion, but Ican't say the same in my spot.I'd lose my job.And no one else would hire me.And I wouldn't be capable of killinganyone or committing the perfect crime.I've got to stick to using science andintuition to put criminals behind bars.But I'm still new,so I can't rely on experience.My gut's all I have to go on.To your success.I only hope I'll succeed beforeyou leave to study abroad.They say it's the bell of love.That's nonsense, man.It's for a city council orcongressional candidate.An election campaign.That's so stupid.We're all being used.That's right.That's what politics is all about.I hate it.Hey, mister.You don't remember me?I remember you.I'm so happy.I wanted to see you.- Come with me.- Okay.Get in.Is this your car?Just get in.Let's go!Faster, faster.Don't be unreasonable.Sir, with this car, we can'tgo any faster...Don't touch it!Damn it.Is he gone?Yasu, go and take a look.Ballistics testing indicates thatthe weapon from last night's murder wasDetective Okada's SW revolver.Hey.Science has unequivocallyproven a connectionbetween the detective's murderand last night's incident.What about the body found in the Cadillac?Science affirmed that it's a17 or 18 year old boy.Any more than that, gentlemen, is up to you.It's only by your enthusiasm and effort thatscience's full potential can be unleashed.If only the police car had arrivedat the scene a bit earlier.Just 7 or 8 minutes after the crime...In those 7 or 8 minutes,the murderer slipped away.With the same M.O. as before.Stealing a nearby car and fleeing the scene.Yes.Yes, it's me.Huh? Yes...What? I knew it.Thanks.Charlie Chen flew to Manila onthe first plane this morning.Really?There's no doubt about it now.It's a yakuza turf war.Detective Okada was killed aftergetting caught up in it.Gentlemen!Investigate the yakuza.So you did wait for me.I haven't forgotten what you said to meon the way home from the racetrack.What did I say, exactly?That if I want to set off fireworkswith the life I have left,to be at this theater onMarch 30 at 7 P.M.Right, that's what I said.Shall we?Did you buy this car?For my next business venture.Business venture?You'll help me?Alright, let's go.He's a member of the university's shootingclub, and he has a driver's license.Boxing, soccer, swimming, bodybuilding...he's very athletic.Being an athlete doesn't meanhe's a murderer though.His father worked in the local government,but committed suicide after being framedfor corruption by a superior.His mother was having an affairwith that very superior,so he ran away from homewhen he was in junior high.He stayed at his aunt's whileattending high school,joined the newspaper club, wrote forthe Young Communist League,got a good scolding for anarticle ridiculing the emperor,then handed out a newspaper exposingthe school's inner workings,and got suspended 10 days for it.He's brave.After that, he went to a Catholic seminary,and lived in a dorm there.At first he took the chapel seriously,but he soon stopped showing up.Then on a test,he wrote a scientific explanationof circumcision and was expelled.- Circumcision?- It's a ritual for a procedure on it.After learning of his expulsion, he pouredsewage on the sanctuary's statue of Christand laughed hysterically.So neither communism nor pietycould heal his heart.After moving to Tokyo andentering the university,he appeared to have become a model student.Among the professors he's known as adiligent, honest, excellent student.Even got permission to study abroad.But in spite of all that he achieved,he got another student pregnant.- Hey!- Yes?One more.Right away.You did your research.- What do you think?- About what?Isn't it compelling?You don't have any hard evidence.This is it.What's all this?In his report he says thatmodern man needs to shed the moralitythat's been laid out for him,and return to being a beast.A beast?That's right.It's the law of nature that onlythe strong survive.And to that end, it's acceptable ifthe weak are sacrificed.That's ridiculous.The thing is, he's been steadilystarting to act.And if we don't stop him, he's going tokeep realizing his plans, one after another.But this isn't enough to prove anything.First of all, we don't have theauthority to bring people inpurely on gut instinct.- Shall we get some udon?- Sure.Sorry, but I'm going to go.Ooh-la-la.- See you later then.- See you.It's been a while.I...I'm thinking of quitting the police.What?It's getting ridiculous.What other job would you do?I'll look.Any job would pay betterthan being a detective.It's the same.Other jobs just havedifferent kinds of despair.I know that.So then why would you quit?I don't like it when you're gloomy.Your life's over if you waste allyour time thinking and worrying.Just be a man and do something.- Even when I try, it doesn't work out.- Because you've no backbone.I'm proof of that.A woman can't just say,"Let's get married even if we're poor."Since you don't take any initiative,it makes me want to be cruel to you.And then you either give upor get depressed.I want you to be assertiveand take the lead.I want you to hold me down.If things don't change, I mightactually leave, you know.I don't want to become an old maid.Let's go.Where?I don't know.Just come with me.Tomorrow the accounts office will receiveentrance fees totalingnearly 30 million yen.I was ripped off myself, 4 years ago.My plan is for you to get thatmoney back, with interest.To put it simply, we're going to rob them.Oh? You're not surprised.You didn't tell me about your planto surprise me, did you?I like you.I'm liking you more and more.I always felt a spark watching all that cashbeing carelessly tossed around.You've felt it too, huh?But it's impossible.The word impossible doesn'texist in my dictionary.They're on high alert.I'm going to blow up the roomI used to study in.There'll be quite a commotion.In that brief window of time...The stakes are awfully high.Young men should take risks.You may end up having to killsomeone, you know.Can you do it?If it's those vile bastards in the accountsoffice, I don't care how many.Mr. Tamaki? Okay.- What about this?- Ah, please wait.- Mr. Yoshikawa?- Thank you for waiting.Next, please.Kenjiro Omori, Japanese literature.- Mr. Kaneko?- Next, please.Next person, please.Next, please.Okay, next please.Accounts OfficeI really didn't expect that anyonefrom our universitywould be selected in the Ridgeway Contest.Even I, the one looking after him,find it unexpected.Well, that paperwouldn't have been completedwithout my considerable advice.I was surprised, nonetheless.- How about one?- Oh, wow!He got 3rd place, did he?The top 3 students can studyabroad for free, right?Well, Date's passport hasalready been issued,and even without this invitation, he wasplanning to fly to America next week.But after all, he must not have much money.It was really weighing on my mind.And that's when I got the news.I was so glad to hear it.Would you like one too?Have you already given him the news?Of course, I've just sent him anexpress message about it.He's not really a people person.On top of that, he's frequently moving.And he doesn't give hisaddress out to anyone.But he left a piece of paper withhis address on it, just for me.He really respects you then, doesn't he?You're so lucky to have such a good student.No, no.Oh, dear!It's tough having to stay andlook after the money.- Who is it?- Excuse me.Could you open the door?You're too late.We already closed.I'm sorry.I've just come from the Seto inlet,but the ferry broke downand I missed the train.Please open the door.Okay.Go around the side, please.- Open it up for him.- All right.Sorry.I really appreciate it.What was that?The research lab!What happened?- It's a fire.- Let's go.Hey, you.Oh, right.Put this away too.And this and this.Everyone up against that wall.Put your hands up.You did well.No need to worry.Drink this and pretend to be drunk.There's sedatives in it too.Two men fled from the main gatein a tan-colored vehicle.Tan-colored?One of them is 5'5", about 20 years old...The flames made the gray ofthe car appear amber in color.Just as I planned.One is 26 or 27 years old,wearing a trench coat,and carrying a suitcase.Inspector 8, Inspector 37.Head immediately to KantoUniversity in Meguro Ward.This is Inspector 37.On my way to Kanto University now.Already heading in the wrong direction.Driver's license.- Just the two of you?- Yes.Where are you headed?We're on our way home froma classmate's wedding.- Who is he?- He's a friend.Hey, wake up.Something happened.He's really had too much to drink.Hey, the police want to ask some questions.Hey.Don't worry about it.Drive safe.I will.It was him.He got the money to study abroad.And from his own university, too.Let's get the bullets to forensics.They're bound to be SW.If so, the guy's truly loathsome.And this loathsome guy'sleaving for the US shortly.Exactly as he's been planning to do.If we fail to catch him,I don't know how I'll beable to live with myself.It might be him...It might not be him...But after all this, it's impossibleto cover one's tracks completely.Let's investigate him.He won't slip up that easily.The money.He won't get rid of the money.I'm sure he'll sleep with his armswrapped around that money tonight.He's gone to a lot of trouble to get it.He'll feel uneasy steppingaway from it for even a moment.That's how the mind of a criminal works.Will we be in time?For what?He's planning to leave in just 3 days.But the only evidence you have isliterary or psychological.Considering how smart he is,he'll give us trouble if we aren't careful.But...Keep your intuition out of this.What we need are facts.Of course we'll pursue him.But there's protocol for gettinga search warrant.He's leaving for America in just 3 days.That said, it won't do any goodif it leads to a public outcry.Chief.I also think he's suspicious.The perpetrator of the crimes so farhasn't wasted a single shot.He's an exceptional marksman,the likes of which Japan has never seen.And to use completelyinnocent young men as shields,and to brutally kill professorsso easily - it's unprecedented.Chikuba ApartmentsKanto UniversityWhere's Mr. Date's room?I heard about it on the radio.The research lab got blown up.It was you, wasn't it?It was.I knew right away.How could I not?I always liked that cruel,animalistic side of you.I knew that you'd be the onlyone who'd figure it out.I'm impressed.What are you going to do now?The landlady doesn't know you're here.Nobody will have any idea.What will you do?Kill me?Yeah, you'll kill me.Go ahead.What are you doing?Stop.It's been more than 3 times.And...I just got rid of your child yesterday.I'm a murderer too.Hi.So we meet again.I'm sorry to bother you.Where were you today?What?Don't play dumb.Where were you at about 7 P.M.?Wherever I want to be is my business.- Answer the question!- He was here.We were having some fun together.Is there any problem?No, just let us take a look around in here.Do you have a warrant?You only have a search warrantfor my apartment, right?That's how it always is with the police.Why don't you just go home already?I'll sue you for trespassing!My apologies.Not even serving you any tea...Take this. Use it.I don't need it anymore.I won the Ridgeway Contest.Use it as a dowry or something.There's 20 million there.Wait.- Thanks.- Have a safe flight.Best of luck!Hip hip hurray!Hurray! Hurray!Nothing's turning up.Neither an accomplice, nor any evidence.There's still 15 minutes.Maybe someone... something...We are pleased to announcethat Pan American Flight 2 departingfor Honolulu and San Franciscois now ready for boarding at Gate 8.I don't know what the truth is anymore.At this rate, he's going tobe a modern-day hero.His future's as bright as this sky.That's not true.But he's already left, hasn't he?Even though he's left the country,there are still ways to go after him.Whether it be Hawaii or San Francisco,he can still be arrested.But he's out of my reach now.He's won.We've clearly lost.The winner still remains to be seen.Look.Thank you for waiting.This bus is bound for the Yeasu exit.All right.There's no such thing as a perfect crime.Once we get some evidence, we're justa phone call away from catching him.The death penalty is what awaits beasts.He's not a beast.No, he's a robot.An elaborate machine created bya modern, twisted society.But even machines falter and get rusty.He made a mistake by not killing that woman.There's evidence waiting for us on that bus.We just can't take our eyes off that woman.THE END
