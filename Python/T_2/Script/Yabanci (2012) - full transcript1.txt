You askedso much already.My wife if putting the kids to bed.I thought you would drink as well.- Is it raki?- Yes, raki.I'll have it.You know my dad, inside.He and your grandfather,I mean your mom's father, are brothers.- We're cousins then.- Yes.Yes.And you're welcome again.Your mom and dad stayed at his house,I mean my dad's house,before running away.In this house?No not this one,in our old house. It's furtherdown the street.Of course, it's demolished now.My parents got away thanksto your dad, didn't they?Uh-huh. They beat my dadup pretty bad.That's why he can't hear well,not because of old age.The police set up a "post" in our house.- At your place?- Yeah, that's how it was called.The police come to our house and wait,...so that when the revolutionaries arrive,they can set an ambush.A revolutionary university student,who stayed in our house once,...is busted and he lets itout during torture.Of course, they take mydad in right away.Though, my dad, he never was angry."I wonder how much they tortured him......how they depraved him of his humanity......so that he would tell us out."He'd say.So my dad and the youngman are in the same room......attached to electrodes.My dad told this all the time.He talked about how ashamed,how tearful, how sad that boy was.At one moment, as it is in Turkey,the power goes out,my dad gets upand hugs that young man,"Aren't you," he says,"one of our brave young men?" he asks."Aren't you one of our sons?" he says."Come now," he says,"stop crying and lift your head up."They don't keep my dad in for long.They release him at once toturn our house into a trap.My dad strives, of course,so that another revolutionarydoesn't come toour place and get caught.It's your mom and dadthey're after, really.At winter time,...my dad writes"Police in the house"...on the mist of the window glass......to keep your mom and dadaway from the house.I always remember this,I was 7 or 8 years old,...but a revolutionary, too.I was thinking thatI could change the world.Well, I still think so,despite everything.You see, my son took after me.And my heroes wereyour parents, in turn.I'm gonna cut it short.My dad made me breakthe police radios.The first time I was beatenby the police, 7 years old.We are blood-related to Selma,I mean your mom,...but everybody loved your father too.My dad also.If my father......could now be told,...if he could understand that,...the man can't be buried in his homeland,...he would utter such curses..."Damn this land, damn this government..."You see, he didn't understandat all what you said at the table.He's old, that's why...And don't even make himstart on Kenan Evren.He would cuss him out so bad,you wouldn't believe...Good evening.- Good evening Ferhat.- Well Ali...- You found your guest, it seems.- I did, I did. Come, sit.Özgür is no stranger. I mean, she isa stranger here but not to us anymore.- So we thought we could have a drink or two.- Don't let me disturb you.Just sit down, Ferhat anddon't even think about it.Welcome again.My late mother,...put these in an Omo box tokeep them away from the police.- Omo?- Yes, a detergent box.- Huh.- The boxes were thicker before,...so she cut the side with a razorand then glued it back again.She couldn't getherself to throw these away.Özgür, come here.Where are you staying?At a hotel.It's, um......close to Taksim.You probably didn't want todisturb Ali and his family.But I wish you stayed there.Taksim isn't the safest place, you know.Well I'm fine at the hotel.You don't need to takeme there either.Don't think about it.You're our guest.But would that you waited a little......I could bring the car here.I did listen to it a lot from Ali.Your mom,...everybody loved Selma so much.I was little, of course......I remember vaguely but......your mom had a good humor.But Ferhat, you think it will work?It's just too old.Kid, you've really growninto an impatient brat.It will work, just wait.Look, my brother rodethis bike, I rode it.It will handle you too, just fine.You sure about that?- You know, I'm gonna beat you so bad-- Well stop it, hey-Ferhat come on,just finish it already.I will, kiddo, I will.As soon as you stop fooling.BienWhat?I learned it from Özgür.Means "good" in French.Not afraid of anything, huh, Ferhat?- Who?- Özgür.You see, she brought her fatherfrom France to here, all alone.She's just like you,you're not afraid of anything, either.Seriously?Seriously...You're not afraid, for sure.Is it finished?It is.Here, enjoy it.- Somebody came to see me?- There.Ferhat, right?I had some business around here.I was wonderingif there was any progress.I mean in the burial procedure.No.None.And look.I found this at home.A photograph of mewith your folks.That's you.Uh-huh. I was very young,of course.- Do you remember the coup?- 1980?Is there any other coup?No there isn't but,something similar.I remember its aftermath, vaguely.You can keep it.As they ran away,there are almost nopictures from Turkey.They burned all the photos,didn't they?My uncle did time in prison too,...he always said..."They made us burnour past through fear."My grandma......had all these wigs, you know?When my uncle was arrested......she took those wigs and threwthem all out to the sea,so that they wouldn't takeher for a militant, too.Let's go out and have somefresh air, if you want.Alright.Wigs, huh?It's hard, for sure.Very, very hard.Maybe you can ask for helpfrom some peopleI mean, we can.From whom?There are still some people.Like an organization or something?Well, not exactly an organization...Non.I want him to be buriedas a human being.Not as a revolutionary.You know what,everything has changed so much, I meanthis is not the country thatyour father left behind.If he wasn't looking at it longingly,from the outside,I don't know if he would stillwant to be buried here.He would.He would.Hello,- I came two days ago-- Wait for your turn.I've been waiting sincethe morning anyway.Tell me the name, what is it?Hüseyin Hasli, I'm his daughter,Özgür Hasli,- My father died, his funeral-- Ok, I remembered it. Look......I told you the last time you came.There is nothing we can do.Maybe the Prime Ministry...Your father is not a Turkish citizen.There is no registry recordabout your father here.You must go to the Prime Minister's office andpresent your petition there, understand?Okay, but I have the petition right here...I know, but you will notgive me your petition,you will give it to the Prime Ministry.We don't have your record here.Go to the Prime Ministryand solve it there.Excuse me.- Hello?- Ali, it's Özgür.Özgür, where are you, my friend?I've been calling the hotelfor three days and I couldn't reach you.You should come here, fast.Is it done then?It's not,...not even close...There's nobody.Well, we should also do some researchand ask around, Özgür.It's a difficult business,can't be solved all at once.Actually, my friends saidhe could be buried under...a different name but-It's not possible,...but this is not the problem.I met some people at the hotel,I talked to themthey say it's easy to burya man, anyway.But no, my father's name will bewritten on that tombstone.You're right.Okay,...let's see what we can do then.Özgür,...come on, stay here......l'm not comfortablewith this arrangement.I'll call you later, and you call me ifanything happens, alright?Özgür dear, let me comeand take you home. Huh?Just don't make me upset.No, thank you very much.Özgür?Özgür?Özgür?I'm leaving.Are you leaving, really?Yes.There's nothing left to do.You didn't try anything I advised.You don't need to get in touchwith them if you want to,I'll take care of it.Why do you help me?Why are you interested?Are you a revolutionary too? Huh?Are you?I just want to leave, really.Well, it couldn't be,I couldn't do it.I couldn't make it work...Look......don't decide so suddenly. I think...Did you eat anything?Shall we?- Özgür?- Huh?Beer?Hey?We'll have fries,meatballs and two beers.I don't think you should go.You came all the way up here.We should find a way to work this out,I mean, to accept it as it is,I don't know.Where's your mother's grave?In Paris.My dad regretted the fact thathe couldn't bring her here......more than her death.But you know what......my mom's graveis much more beautiful......than the shitty graves here.I'm thinking about whatcan be done, but-Nothing.Nothing...Nothing.Ali and his family are yourmother's relatives, right?Uh-huh.Did you contactyour father's relatives, then?- I didn't.- Why?I don't know.My dad didn't have contact with them.I don't know.I think it would bebeneficial to contact them.Beneficial?Benefit...Absolutely.Benefit!Come on, let's go.I have to wash my face.Özgür?Özgür?O-okay.Özgür look,- I know, stop-- You don't know!
