Pamban bridge.An ocean.Two shores.An incident that took place sevenyears ago in this bridge...became a huge issue and as a result...Rameswaram and Ramanathapuram, that aregeographically isolated islands,are now seperated emotionally too.Carrying out fishing businessin Rameswaram,heading the fishermen association thereand controlling that whole town is...Samudharam's family.40 years ago...


a not-so-rich family came down toRamanathapuram from Tirunelveli district.Now they own a Freshwater Prawn farmover 240 acres.That's PRV family.One of the biggest Prawn Processing Unit...is PRV Sea Foods.In this company, whereover 600 employees work,prawns are exported to many countriesvia Tuticorin port.Not just that...Bus service,Lorry service,Theater,Marriage hall etc. ...Running all these business andthus being pride of this place is...PRV Group.


Sir, this is my brother-in-law PRV.We heard that after a long gapyou have come here, to our temple.And so he wanted you to readthe horoscopes of his sons.How many sons do you have?Four sons, sir.Give me their horoscopes.This is my eldest son's.Ramachandran.What the hell is this?An anchovy, sir.If this single fish mixes up withprawns and reaches London...The buyer will send backthe whole consignment!Then everything turn in to dry fish.You'll have to take those andsell it in local Gandhi market.I'll rip you apart!Brother...Chinna Annachi and committee membersof our association are here.-Greetings Annachi.-Welcome.Greetings.Please have a seat.Please convey the matter to him.Dear...our association electionwill be held next month.We have decided that you mustcontest for the Head post.What about Mr. Subbiah annachi?Well, he is an option...but a successful and reputedbusinessman like you...will make our associationeven more stronger.Annachi...there are more than 650 employeesworking in our company.Most of them belong to different castes.So him becoming the head ofassociation of a caste...might not be goodfor his reputation.Yet, since we have faith andtrust in our community...all the immediate employees belowus are appointed from our caste.Why can't you become the Head?Who's stopping you?Myself? But then... how can I...Look here...we might have migratedhere from Tirunelveli...We could be the minority...but we should flourish well.You conduct the campaignsand wield the mic.Place cut outs and stick bills.I shall do the complete funding for it.But PRV family's name...shouldn't appear in anydesignation or poster.This is my youngest son,Ravichandran's horoscope.You tell me that he isthe youngest son...but seems to be the eldest one.Sir, my brother-in-law's firstwife passed away long back.This is second wife's son.My elder sister's son."Who is the reason for our sorrow?Why are we sorrow?""He left the world in his prime.He left without exploring his life""He left his father lonelyand his brother to suffer""Wasn't even luckyto have a family life"So who's this Pandi?See there. That's Samudhram and Pandiis his deceased son.He died seven years ago.And they celebrate his deathanniversary every year.Our district MLA, MP,villagers, relatives...and people from all castescome to pay respect.But none from PVR family or their castecome to pay respect.Such is the rivalry.Ancestral properties andbusiness are in my name.I feel I must divide it among my sonswhen I'm hale and healthy.Please read their horoscopes andtell me if it's in their favour now.This boy...won't even get a handfulof soil from your wealth.But forever...he will be your family's biggest hold.He is like an elephant.He will carry you all in his shoulders.Even if the smallest of problemfinds your family...then he won't have mercy on anyone.He'll knock them down and stomp them!Sir, PRV Ravi is goingon the Thekkuvadi route.Why is he headed to Pandian'sdeath anniversary location?Sir, shall I order our men innext check post to block him.That'd invite us only trouble.-Use all the police 'under rest'-Okay, sir.Guys, time to work. Get up.No matter how big the problem is...he'll face it single handedly!How come the dead person is alive?That's the elder brotherof the deceased.They are twins.He's out on a four day parolefrom the prison.Pandi is not dead.He is still alive in my form.I'll be out of prison soon.All of you be prepared to die.You left this place with your twinbut look; only you have returned.How could you let yourbrother die, dear hubby?Lingam...you both are the apple of my eyesand they poked out one of you!Get down!Push! Push!Push! Come on!Get the weapon!Maari push!Now what's happening?Can't see him inside.-Muthualagu!-Boss?Go and check.Listen Anbu...PRV family and Samudhramfamily are having a rivalry...but why are you intruding in between?Move the boat, you!Instead of pouncing intothe road with boats...if you had taken it to Kavara island,you could've got morefishes and earned extra.At least your wife would've been happy.Stop showing off! I can seeyou are scared to death.Scared are the ones whoare holding weapons.Why would the one holdingthe cigarette, be scared?I'll show you what fear looks like!Come on, do it!

Realize thatbefore you set out Mr. Broker!Dear sister-in-law...kneading the dough is my rightand I ain't giving it up.If two people knead the dough, it won'tturn out soft.

Talk with respector else I'll thrash you.Ma, they laid hands on Jimmy.How can I not retaliate?So you'll hit them just becausethey hit this dog?Why did you hit him?My ears are echoing amidstthe ego clash between brothers.There, I hit him. Now come, hit me!Hit me!Stop kidding please.Stop yelling, guys.Calm down and discuss.Today you were in police custody.Tomorrow you'll be in prison!And we must get ashamed!I asked the inspector to arrest me.Now what new story is that?There were CCTV camerasall over the bar.On top, those men were hurt very badly.It was obvious thatthe issue will blow up.Hence, I asked him to book meunder section #75.I wonder how many more rivalrieswe'll have to face because of him.Having drunkards at home andour dignity is going for a toss.For what reason did you go to the bar?It's all because of your wife.What did I do?You asked me to buyfive litres of oil.Did you give me abottle to fetch it?So I stepped into the liquorshop to get an empty bottle.I had a big fight with thescrap bottle collector.Thanks to Ravi anna, he interferedand it ended in a fight.If it was me, there would'vebeen dead bodies lying around!-Not believable?-Doofus!Then why are you hearingit with such interest?How arrogant!Police station...What's wrong?-Tell me, what did you do?-Ma...Please sit.I've decided to murder Lingam, ma.The men I bashed today morning...were Lingam's men.What happened?Everyone's angry on you thinkingyou got drunk and created nuisance.You could've told this to your brothers.And what?Everyone's peace of mindwill be lost, ma.It's only fair that all thethe family members stay happy...and only one personbear all the pain.He hasn't changed aftercoming out of prison.All these daysthey kept targetting us...and we faced it all quietly.Even a small scratch on children...and we won't be able to bear it.Won't it kill us all?We can't be alert all the time.Along with all the sinscommitted so far...I shall stab him and...go to prison for a while.At least our family's happinesswill be in tact.I don't see any other option, ma.Okay, let's see.He barged into a shut downbar and provoked our men.He didn't give them a chance. He justbashed them up and broke their fingers.And the police is on their side.Yet the police arrested Ravi.Doesn't add up. Something's fishy.That means he surely heard Manickamtell you that he'll chop of boy's thumb.Hereafter even if we make asmall move in his town...He'll come to know.When is Magalam akka gettingreleased from sub-jail?Tell me, dear.I've made a decision.It's regarding my life.Then it's regarding my life too.Tell me.No matter what...I always make decision after praying toJesus in Katchatheevu Anthonyaar Church.Then go ahead.It'll open only for the festival,next month.That's when we'll havepermission to go there.You want to go to Katchatheevu, right?I'll take you there in an hour.Step out.Where is he going without me?My leg! My leg!

Hence he did this.Looks like he'll becomeour mortal enemy.Jaya, ask advocate Senguttuvan to come.Annachi, your point sounds good...but all of a sudden ifyou ask your brother...to sign settlement document,do you think he'll sign it?He is a crook!He doesn't have to do it for nothing.For my dad's mistake;the Sakkarkotai house...40 acres in Paramkudi highway...and he can have the car he is driving.Let him ram it anywhere!Offer him all these.And ask him to come and sign.See kiddo, if not a rod, at leastyou must give a small log.Instead you're offering an ear bud.Even if you have to settle him in a fairway, he must get 1/4th of the wealth.But you guys are being unfair and...didn't even let him to do thefinal rites duty to his father...and left him stranded outside the gate.Do you think he'll keep quiet?He'll demand a share for his mother too!Because her name will be the firstin the Legal Heir Certificate!Let that be aside, Ramachandran.Your daughter, who is on a tour...If she returns, she alsois entitled to a share.Because she is now 18+.She is a major now.You want PRV's wealth to be written offto that Keezhakarai bhai's son?That's what the law states!Three shares there andthree shares for you guys.The total value of the wealthis 850 crores.425 over there and here.So give it a good thought,Mister Ramachandran.So, see you.
