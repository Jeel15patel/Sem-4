It is like an additional module of Node JS.
Features Of Express JS:
- Building a Dynamic Website.
- Creating Full Stack Web-App.
- Express JS is more Faster than Node JS and less Complexity.
> To open static files i.e images, css, html express.static(foldername) is used.
  This work as bulit-in middleware funcion.
> app.use(express.static(foldername)) : this function opens the correspnding resources
  and use it
> Post Method: app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended:false}))
> if extended is True you get depricated data and if False you get
  in form of js library query string.

What is Middleware?
> Express JS is a routing and middleware framework for handling the different routing in webpage
  and it works between response and request cycle.
> It is executed after the server recieves the request and before the controller action sends the
  response.
> It has access to the request object, response object and next.
> It can process the request before the server sends the response.
> It can process request object multiple times before the server works for that request.
> It can be used to add login and authentication funcionality.
> It improves Client-side rendering performance, it hepls for optimizaiton and better performance.

Cookies:-
> const cp = require('cookie-parser') -> Module for cookie.
> res.cookie("name","value","expiry") -> Creates a cookie.{e: new Date(Date.now+10000)}
> req.cookie -> To send and fetch a cookie, if you want a specific cookie, then we can retrive it
                by appending the name of cookie.
> res.clearCookie("cookie-name") -> Deletes a cookie.

Session in JS:-
> Since http is a stateless protocol, to assosciate a request to any other request, you need
  a way to store user data, between http request.
> Cookies and url parameters are suitable way to transport data between client and server
  but they are readable on client side.
> Session solves this problem, using session we can assign the client an ID and it makes
  all further request using that id only.
session({
  reserve: False            #Doesn't save session if not modified
  saveUninitialized: False  #Dont Create session if something is not stored
  secret:"key"              #If the Secret key is changed, the session is considered as fresh session and its value will be reset
})

Multer:-
> Multer accepts an option Object, the most basic of which is the storage property which tells Multer
  where to upload the files.
> In case you emmit the option object, the files will be kept in memory and never return to the
  list.
> Storage -> Where to store a file.
> File filter -> funcion to control which files are accepted. 
> limits -> Limits of uploaded data.
> Preserve Path -> Keep the full file path of the files instead of just basename.
> fieldname='single' -> This accepts a single file with the name field name

PUG:- 
> It is JS that was know sa JADE
> It is easy to code templet engine use to code html in more readable fashion 
> PUG is sensitive in white space.
  > Buffered Data = //
  > unbuffered Data = //-
  > Multiline
