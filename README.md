Regarding your Sem-4 studies, I understand that you have some college lectures on Python and FSD (full stack developer) that you want to share. It's always helpful to have resources like this for studying. If anyone notices any errors in the code, they can reach out to you at 15jeel6201patel@gmail.com. Best of luck with your studies!
